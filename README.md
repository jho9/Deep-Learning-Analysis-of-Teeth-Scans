# Deep-Learning-Analysis-of-Teeth-Scans

Python repository for Jessica Vincenty's "Archaelogy or crime scene? Teeth micro and macro structure analysis as dating variable"

The python file is currently formated as a .ipynb which requires a jupyter notebook to run.

The enviroment that it was intiially ran in was from Kaggle.com and their free GPU usage.

When runing the file itself it produces a series of csvs that summarize their stratified k-fold results.

<i> Simple methods to aid in the determination of forensic or archaeologic relevancy of skeletonized remains have been researched since the 1950s.  With advances in microscopic imaging techniques and machine learning computer data analysis methods the relevancy of decontextualized, comingled remains has room for improvement.  This thesis is a study done to pioneer a new approach to analyzing dental skeletal remains to determine forensic relevancy.   

                 Archaeological dental samples collected from the ancient city of Ur in modern day southern Iraq in addition to modern dental extractions were processed for scanning electron microscopy imaging.  The image files were then analyzed using a custom-built convolutional neural net model.  The modelâ€™s performance metrics indicate that the model made predictions based on learned associations rather than a 50/50 guess.  Thus, the use of scanning electron microscopy and machine learning analysis techniques has potential in distinguishing archaeological dental samples from modern dental samples.</i>
